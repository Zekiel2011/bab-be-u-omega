Thank you for trying out Bab Be U Omega - The Random Stuff Update!

WHAT IS THIS?
Bab Be U Omega is a mod of Bab Be U that adds more stuff, it's a work in progress and the progress for the game might be slow because I don't really know much about coding so please don't rush me :(

HOW DO?:
firs, donload love2d!!
nex, how run gam: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Running_Games

Please, I wanna know how to play without the joke-like text thats like the text above:
1. You will need to download Love2D's installer. Get it here "https://love2d.org/"
2. Open the installer, and install it.
3. Open the folder where it was installed. You need the .exe file thats named "love", not "lovec".
3b. If you want to make stuff more easier, make a shortcut of the .exe, and maybe put it in your desktop area, or somewhere you can easily find and acess it.
4. Get the folder of the game, and drag it onto the .exe, you will need it so the folder will get opened by the .exe file.
5. And BAM! you should be playing my mod! (Keep in mind this is also how you open other Love2D games.)

For some weird reason I forgot to remove SOG from the Extra Objects tab or something along the name of that, just pretend its only in the Platforys Modds tab.
